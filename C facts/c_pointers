// About variable addr and pointer addr
Look at this example:
    int n = 324;
    int *ptr = &n;
Here ptr and &n evaluates to same addrs:
    code:
        printf("%p %p\n", &n, ptr);
    output:
        0x7ffc1df59ef4 0x7ffc1df59ef4 ; Ofcourse it might be different in yours case ; Here, ptr == &n evaluates to true
I can put it this way:
    ptr = variable n's addr, basically spits away n's addr
    &ptr = It is ptr pointer's own addr, spits ptr's addr
